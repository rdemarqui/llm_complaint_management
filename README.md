## Overview
Analyzing user complaints is a crucial challenge for many organizations, involving understanding and effectively responding to customer concerns. One of the main challenges is the variety and complexity of complaints, which can vary in language and content, making accurate interpretation difficult. Moreover, the high volume of complaints necessitates automated processes for efficient management. The third major challenge is extracting valuable insights from complaints, going beyond mere cataloging. 

Effective analysis should identify underlying causes and trends, requiring sophisticated approaches that understand nuances and patterns in user complaints. Large Language Models (LLM) are emerging as vital tools for deal with this type of business problem.

In recent years, we have witnessed a surge in the development of open-source Large Language Models (LLM), a phenomenon that is redefining the boundaries of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Among the most notable innovations in this area is the quantization of models, a technique that optimizes performance without significantly compromising accuracy. This study aims to explore these technological advancements, specifically using the advanced LLM tool Mistral 7B, to analyze a vast collection of complaints gathered from the website reclameaqui.com.br. Through this analysis, we intend to demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting and handling large-scale user feedback.
